This is my online space where I write stuff. Some blog posts, running lists, and maybe eventually other goodies

**Bio**

I'm a 43 year old, married Dad who lives in Toronto. I've worked as a Business Analyst and Product Owner since 2011 in Telecom and Technology. I've been in the work-from-home lifestyle since 2008. I love to eat and drink, lift heavy weights, read, and listen to music.

I'm an irregular blogger but a regular updater of running lists.
